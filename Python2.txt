Operators in python:

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators

Arithmetic operators:
These operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathemetical operations.

Assignment operators:
These are used to assign values to variables.

Comparison operators:
These are used to compare two values.

Logical operators:
These are used to combine conditional statements.

Identity operators:
These are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with same memory location.

Membership operators:
These are used to test if a sequence is present in an object or not.

Bitwise operators:
These are used to compare binary numbers.

Precedence of operators:
To evaluate the expressions there is a rule called precedence in python. It guides the order in which these operations are carried out.
The order is as follows:

1. Paranthesis
2. Exponent
3. Unary plus, unary minus, Bitwise not
4. Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus
5. Addition, subtraction
6. Bitwise shift operators
7. Bitwise AND
8. Bitwise XOR
9. Bitwise OR
10. Comparisons, identity, membership operators
11. Logical NOT
12. Logical AND
13. Logical OR
